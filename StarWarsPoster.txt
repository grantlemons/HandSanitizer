It is a period of quarantine.
Safe Students, striking
from a hidden base, have won
their first victory against
the evil Corona Virus.

During the battle, Students 
managed to steal secret
plans to the Virus's
ultimate weakeness, the
HAND SANITIZER, a powerfull
jell with enough power to
destroy the Virus.

Pursued by the Virus's
sinister agents, Students
have constructed a sanitizer
station that can save
the students and restore
freedom to the school.....
